# PCB Computer Vision Project
### Overview
This project aims to develop a computer vision system that utilizes Faster R-CNN to detect and classify electronic components, specifically capacitors, resistors, and integrated circuits (ICs), on printed circuit boards (PCBs).

### Features
* Component Detection: Identify capacitors, resistors, and ICs with high accuracy.
* Real-Time Processing: Leverage Faster R-CNN for fast inference times.
* Visual Output: Display bounding boxes around detected components.
