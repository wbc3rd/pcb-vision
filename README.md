# PCB Computer Vision Project
### Overview
This project implements a computer vision system that utilizes a Faster R-CNN variant to detect and classify electronic components, specifically capacitors, resistors, and integrated circuits (ICs), on printed circuit boards (PCBs). It's primary purpose is labeling components and determing whether they are good or defective.

### Features
* Component Detection: Identify capacitors, resistors, and ICs with high accuracy.
* Component Classification: Determine whether indentified components are good or defective.
* Real-Time Processing: Leverage Faster R-CNN for fast inference times.
* Visual Output: Display bounding boxes around detected components along with labels and confidence scores.
* Present an intuitive front end using StreamlitIO that allows users to upload their own images for component detection.
