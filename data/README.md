This directory contains the data (Git LFS) for the pcb-vision project. It also contains the necessary json files for bound box annotations used in training the model. The file "result.json" contains all 179 image identifiers and 1124 separate annotations.
Running the cocosplit.py script found in the src directory splits these annotations up randomly into 70% (training) and 30% (validation). These files have already been generated and are present in this directory as "train.json" and "test.json".
